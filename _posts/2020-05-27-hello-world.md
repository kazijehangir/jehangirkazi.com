/h1 Syncing between a Github repo and Wordpress

I have been trying to set up this site in a way that allows me to easily write posts on the go and publish them automatically with version control (preferably through Github). I set up a WP extension called Wordpress Github Sync which offers to do that. It exported my existing posts into a new Github repo, but some pages were not formatted correctly. I’m now testing the reverse sync of pushing a page to Github and seeing if it get’s formatted correctly.
